Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for the same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. \n  * The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization typically reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. \n  * Some popular problems solved using Dynamic Programming are [Fibonacci Numbers,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/) Diff Utility ([Longest Common Subsequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/)), [Bellman–Ford Shortest Path](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/), [Floyd Warshall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/floyd-warshall-algorithm-dp-16/), [Edit Distance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/edit-distance-dp-5/) and [Matrix Chain Multiplication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/matrix-chain-multiplication-dp-8/).\n\n\n![Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250106170245473186/Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-1.webp)![Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250106170245473186/Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-1.webp)\n![Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250106170245473186/Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-1.webp)![Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250106170245473186/Dynamic-Programming-or-DP-1.webp)\nPrevious Play Next 1 / 2\n  \n\n## ****Basic of DP****\n  * [Introduction to DP ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-dynamic-programming-data-structures-and-algorithm-tutorials/)\n  * [Tabulation vs Memoization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/tabulation-vs-memoization/)\n  * [Steps to solve a DP Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/solve-dynamic-programming-problem/)\n\n\n## ****Basic Problems****\n  * [Fibonacci numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/)\n  * [Tribonacci Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/tribonacci-numbers/)\n  * [Lucas Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/lucas-numbers/)\n  * [Climbing Stairs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/)\n  * [Climbing Stairs with 3 Moves](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/count-ways-reach-nth-stair-using-step-1-2-3/)\n  * [Weighted Climbing Stairs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/minimum-cost-to-reach-the-top-of-the-floor-by-climbing-stairs/)\n  * [Maximum Segments ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/maximize-the-number-of-segments-of-length-p-q-and-r/)\n  * [nth Catalan Number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/program-nth-catalan-number/)\n  * [Count Unique BSTs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/number-of-unique-bst-with-a-given-key-dynamic-programming/)\n  * [Count Valid Parenthesis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/find-number-valid-parentheses-expressions-given-length/)\n  * [Ways to Triangulate a Polygon](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/number-of-ways-a-convex-polygon-of-n2-sides-can-split-into-triangles-by-connecting-vertices/)\n  * [Min Sum in a Triangle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/minimum-sum-path-triangle/)\n  * [Minimum Perfect Squares](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/minimum-number-of-squares-whose-sum-equals-to-given-number-n/)\n  * [Ways to Partition a Set](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/bell-numbers-number-of-ways-to-partition-a-set/)\n  * [Binomial Coefficient](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/binomial-coefficient-dp-9/)\n  * [Pascal's Triangle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/pascal-triangle/)\n  * [Nth Row of Pascal Triangle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/find-the-nth-row-in-pascals-triangle/)\n  * [Min Sum in a Triangle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/minimum-sum-path-triangle/)\n\n\n## ****Easy Problems****\n  * [House Robber](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/find-maximum-possible-stolen-value-houses/)\n  * [Min Cost Path](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/min-cost-path-dp-6/)\n  * [Decode Ways](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/count-possible-decodings-given-digit-sequence/)\n  * [Subset Sum Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/)\n  * [Coin change problem -

You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `ith` vertex in **clockwise order**.\n**Polygon** **triangulation** is a process where you divide a polygon into a set of triangles and the vertices of each triangle must also be vertices of the original polygon. Note that no other shapes other than triangles are allowed in the division. This process will result in `n - 2` triangles.\nYou will **triangulate** the polygon. For each triangle, the _weight_ of that triangle is the product of the values at its vertices.

It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. It's an interpreted language that executes code line by line, providing more flexibility****.****\n  * ****Client Side:**** On the client side, JavaScript works along with HTML and CSS. HTML adds structure to a web page, CSS styles it, and JavaScript brings it to life by allowing users to interact with elements on the page, such as actions on clicking buttons, filling out forms, and showing animations. JavaScript on the client side is directly executed in the user's browser.\n  * ****Server Side**** : On the Server side (on Web Servers), JavaScript is used to access databases, file handling, and security features to send responses****,**** to browsers.\n\n\n![Client-Side-JavaScript.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250514181403972719/Client-Side-JavaScript.webp)![Client-Side-JavaScript.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250514181403972719/Client-Side-JavaScript.webp)\n![Server-Side-JavaScript.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250514181403972719/Client-Side-JavaScript.webp)![Server-Side-JavaScript.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250514181403972719/Client-Side-JavaScript.webp)\nPrevious Play Next 1 / 2\n## Why Learn JavaScript?\n  * Core language for web development, enabling dynamic and interactive features in websites with fewer lines of code.\n  * Highly in demand, offering many job opportunities in Frontend, Backend (Node.js), and Full Stack Development.\n  * Supports powerful frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js, and Express.js, widely used in modern web applications.\n  * Object-oriented and event-driven language, ideal for building scalable and responsive applications.\n  * Cross-platform and runs directly in all modern web browsers without the need for installation.\n  * Major companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon use JavaScript in their tech stacks.\n\n\n## Write and Run Your First JavaScript Program\nMostly browsers can run JavaScript directly, so there's no need to install a compiler. However, the built-in browser console isn’t very beginner-friendly. That’s why we’ve added an online editor below to help you get started easily.\nJavaScript `\n\n`\n  \n**Output**```\nHello World!"}

If there is no ****common subsequence**** , return `0`. A ****subsequence**** is a string generated from the original string by deleting 0 or more characters, without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. \nFor example, subsequences of \"ABC\" are \"\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"AB\", \"AC\", \"BC\" and \"ABC\".

If you traverse the cycle, the total weight accumulated would be less than zero.\n![BellmanFord-Algorithm-eXAMPLE](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250411172807132937/BellmanFord-Algorithm-eXAMPLE.webp)\nIn the presence of negative weight cycle in the graph, the shortest path ****doesn't exist**** because with each traversal of the cycle shortest path keeps ****decreasing****.\n### Limitation of Dijkstra's Algorithm:\nSince, we need to find the****single source shortest path**** , we might initially think of using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm/). However, Dijkstra is not suitable when the graph consists of ****negative edges****. The reason is, it ****doesn't revisit**** those nodes which have already been marked as visited. If a shorter path exists through a longer route with negative edges, Dijkstra's algorithm will fail to handle it. \n### Principle of Relaxation of Edges\n  * Relaxation means ****updating**** the shortest distance to a node if a shorter path is found through another node. For an edge ****(u, v)**** with weight ****w**** :\n    * If going through u gives a shorter path to v from the source node (i.e., ****distance[v] > distance[u] + w****), we update the distance[v] as distance[u] + w.\n  * In the bellman-ford algorithm, this process is repeated ****(V - 1)**** times for all the edges.\n\n\n### ****Why Relaxing Edges (V - 1) times gives us Single Source Shortest Path?****\nA shortest path between two vertices can have at most ****(V - 1)**** edges. It is not possible to have a simple path with more than (V - 1) edges (otherwise it would form a cycle). Therefore, repeating the relaxation process (V - 1) times ensures that all possible paths between source and any other node have been covered.\nAssuming node ****0**** as the ****source**** vertex, let's see how we can relax the edges to find the shortest paths: \n![baleman-fort](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241016175632718977/baleman-fort.webp)\n  * In the ****first relaxation**** , since the shortest paths for vertices 1 and 2 are unknown (infinite, i.e., 108), the shortest paths for vertices 2 and 3 will also remain infinite (108)` `. And, for vertex 1, the distance will be updated to 4, as `dist[0] + 4 < dist[1]` (i.e., `0 + 4 < `108).\n  * In the ****second relaxation**** , the shortest path for vertex 2 is still infinite (e.g. 108), which means the shortest path for vertex 3 will also remain infinite. For vertex 2, the distance can be updated to 3, as dist[1] + (-1) = 3.\n  * In the ****third relaxation**** , the shortest path for vertex 3 will be updated to 5, as dist[2] + 2 = 5.\n\n\nSo, in above example, ****dist[1]**** is updated in ****1st relaxation**** , ****dist[2]**** is updated in ****second relaxation**** , so the dist for the last node (V - 1), will be updated in ****(V - 1) th relaxation****. \n### Detection of a Negative Weight Cycle\n  * As we have discussed earlier that, we need (V - 1) relaxations of all the edges to achieve single source shortest path. If one ****additional relaxation**** (Vth) for any edge is possible, it indicates that some edges with overall negative weight has been traversed once more.

If there is no direct edge, `dist[i][j]` is set to a large value (e.g., 10⁸) to represent infinity. The diagonal entries `dist[i][i]` are `0`, since the distance from a node to itself is zero. The graph ****may contain negative edge weights**** , but it ****does not contain any negative weight cycles****.\nYour task is to determine the ****shortest path distance**** between all pair of nodes**`**i**`**and**`**j**`**in the graph.\n****Example:****\n[Try it on GfG Practice![redirect icon](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Group-arrow.svg) ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implementing-floyd-warshall2042/1)\n### Floyd Warshall Algorithm:\nThe ****Floyd–Warshall algorithm**** works by maintaining a two-dimensional array that represents the distances between nodes. Initially, this array is filled using only the direct edges between nodes. Then, the algorithm gradually updates these distances by checking if shorter paths exist through intermediate nodes. \nThis algorithm works for both the ****directed**** and ****undirected weighted**** graphs and can handle graphs with both ****positive**** and ****negative weight edges****. \n****Note**** : It does not work for the graphs with negative cycles (where the sum of the edges in a cycle is negative).\n### Idea Behind Floyd Warshall Algorithm:\n### ****Why Floyd Warshall Works (Correctness Proof)?****\nThe algorithm relies on the ****principle of optimal substructure**** , meaning:\n  * If the shortest path from i to j passes through some vertex k, then the path from i to k and the path from k to j must also be shortest paths.\n  * The iterative approach ensures that by the time vertex k is considered, all shortest paths using only vertices 0 to k-1 have already been computed.\n\n\nBy the end of the algorithm, all shortest paths are computed optimally because each possible intermediate vertex has been considered.\n### Why Floyd-Warshall Algorithm better for Dense Graphs and not for Sparse Graphs?\n****Step-by-step implementation****\n  * ****Start by updating the distance matrix**** by treating each vertex as a possible intermediate node between all pairs of vertices.\n  * ****Iterate through each vertex**** , one at a time. For each selected vertex `k`, attempt to improve the shortest paths that pass through it.\n  * When we pick vertex number ****k**** as an intermediate vertex, we already have considered vertices ****{0, 1, 2, .. k-1}**** as intermediate vertices. \n  * For every pair****(i, j)**** of the source and destination vertices respectively, there are two possible cases. \n    * ****k**** is not an intermediate vertex in shortest path from****i**** to****j****. We keep the value of****dist[i][j]**** as it is. \n    * ****k**** is an intermediate vertex in shortest path from ****i**** to****j****. We update the value of****dist[i][j]**** as ****dist[i][k] + dist[k][j],**** if ****dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]****\n  * Repeat this process for each vertex `k` until all intermediate possibilities have been considered.\n\n\n****Illustration:****\n![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)\n![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)\n![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)\n![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)\n![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)\n![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)\n![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)![Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250414145110313876/Floyd-Warshall-Algorithm-01.webp)\nPrevious Play Next 1 / 7\n  \n\nC++ `\n\n` Java `\n\n` Python `\n\n` C# `\n\n` JavaScript `\n\n`\n  \n**Output**```\n0 4 5 5 7 \n3 0 1 4 6 \n2 6 0 3 5 \n3 7 1 0 2 \n1 5 5 4 0"}
